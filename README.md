PongProcessingScala
-
Requirements
-----------
- Intellij IDEA or Community Edition
- Scala Plugin

The project already contains the Processing related files(core.jar...) and [Guava libraries] which are needed.

Installation
------------
- Install Intellij + Scala Plugin (if it is not already installed)
- Open Intellij -> Check out from Version Control -> GitHub -> Url: https://github.com/fxlex/PongProcessingScala.git -> Clone
- Find file PongApplication in src -> right click -> run as PongApplication Main
- Maybe you also have to  select "Use classpath from module".
- You can also run it as an applet if you run Pong instead of PongApplication.
